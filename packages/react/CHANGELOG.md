# @vivari/react

From 1.1.0 on, entries are generated from [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
`@vivari/core` and `@vivari/react` are released together under the same version, so a release

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#9](https://github.com/maitrungduc1410/vivari/pull/9) [`973e503`](https://github.com/maitrungduc1410/vivari/commit/973e503c1b1a5e4c792635b2cc1bd8f43442f12e) Thanks [@ThailerL](https://github.com/ThailerL)! - Add a `connection` event (with the `ConnectionEvent` and `ConnectionListener` types) that fires when one process in the VM opens a TCP connection to a server in another, before either end can send anything. It reports the server's port, the connection's `remotePort`, both pids, and the client's still-running ancestors.
